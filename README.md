# ico-crypto_dev
Lauching of token for crypto dev

**Requirements** <br/>
- There will be a max of 10,000 CD tokens.
- Every [Crypto Dev NFT holder](https://github.com/greatsamist/nft-collection) should get 10 tokens for free but they would have to pay the gas fees.
- The price of one CD at the time of ICO should be 0.001 ether
- There is a website which users can visit for the ICO.


**Theory** <br/>
What is an [ERC20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/)? <br/>
ERC-20 is a technical standard; it is used for all smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for token implementation and provides a list of rules that all Ethereum-based tokens must follow.<br/>
